ConceptScheme URI,http://vocabs.lter-europe.net/eLTER_CL,Main GUPRI (i.e. PID) under which all terms are defined. Preference is to use PURLs or W3IDs as they provide permanent resolvable identifiers.
"Prefixes for controlled vocabularies, schema and ontologies"
PREFIX,cl,http://vocabs.lter-europe.net/eLTER_CL/,Prefix for our controlled vocabulary since it is rather tedious to write long URLs all the time
PREFIX,skos,http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#,Prefix for SKOS Ontology. This ontology is which our base for defining terms.
PREFIX,pav,http://purl.org/pav/ ,"Prefix for Provenance, Authoring and Versioning Ontology which properties such as version and createdOn we will use to describe our controlled vocabulary"
PREFIX,dct,http://purl.org/dc/terms/ ,"Prefix for Dublin Core (Terms) Ontology which properties such as title, description, rights, source, etc. we will use to describe our controlled vocabulary as well to define its terms"
PREFIX,iop,https://w3id.org/iadopt/ont/,The I-ADOPT Framework is an ontology designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable description models.
PREFIX,qudt,http://qudt.org/schema/qudt/,"Prefix for ""Quantity, Unit, Dimension and Type"" schema that is used to model physical units."
PREFIX,unit,http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/,"Prefix for QUDT Vocabulary of Units which terms we will use to semantically define units of measurements for terms (i.e., variables) we are defining"
